#' Generate six RF models from two classes
#' 
#' This returns a list with one random forest model
#' 
#' 
#' The followind had no significant improvement and took too much time. In the future it may be activated with another parameter.  
#' *It will return a list with 3 normal rf models and 3 rf models made with randomized labels.
#' The models 1 and 2 are trained without any subsampling.
#' #' The models 3 and 4 are trained using upsampling during the cross-validation (Subsampling During Resampling).
#' The models 5 and 6 are trained using downsampling during the cross-validation (Subsampling During Resampling).*
